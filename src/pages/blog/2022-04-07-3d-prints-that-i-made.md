### Here is a sample of a few projects that I have done.

The Mandalorian is my biggest and most rewarding print that I have ever made. I will be adding additional color highlights to this in the near feature.

The next best print I did is a working Iron Man Arc Reactor that lights up. I actually gave this to my friend as a birthday present.

The Pirates of the Caribbean Medallion stash that I'm building up.
